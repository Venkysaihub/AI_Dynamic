    <h1>How Much Does Car Recovery Cost in Manchester?</h1>
    <p>When your vehicle breaks down or you’re involved in an accident, one of the first concerns is the cost of car recovery. The price of recovery services can vary based on vehicle size, distance, time, and service type. Let’s break down the factors that affect car recovery costs in Manchester.</p>
    
    <h2>Vehicle Size and Weight</h2>
    <p>Larger vehicles cost more to tow as they require more resources.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Light-Duty Vehicles:</strong> Cars, motorcycles, and small vans are cheaper to tow.</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy-Duty Vehicles:</strong> Trucks and commercial vehicles need specialized equipment, raising costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Distance and Location</h2>
    <p>The farther the vehicle is from the recovery service, the higher the cost.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Recoveries:</strong> Shorter distances are generally cheaper.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-Distance Recoveries:</strong> More time and fuel are needed for remote locations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Time of Day and Urgency</h2>
    <p>Recovery services during off-hours (nights, weekends, holidays) often incur higher fees.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Emergency Recovery:</strong> Costs more for immediate service, especially outside business hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Scheduled Services:</strong> Generally more affordable during regular hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Type of Recovery Service</h2>
    <p>The type of service impacts pricing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Towing:</strong> Less expensive for small cars and short distances.</li>
        <li><strong>Accident Recovery:</strong> Requires additional work and equipment, raising costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Roadside Assistance:</strong> More affordable for minor issues like flat tires or dead batteries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Fees</h2>
    <p>Additional charges may apply depending on the situation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage Fees:</strong> If the vehicle needs to be stored.</li>
