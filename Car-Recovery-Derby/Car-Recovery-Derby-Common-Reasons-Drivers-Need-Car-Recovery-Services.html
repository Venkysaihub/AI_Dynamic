    <ul>
        <li>Lack of regular maintenance.</li>
        <li>Oil or coolant leaks.</li>

    <h2>2. Flat Tires</h2>
    <p>A punctured or blown tire can make your vehicle undrivable, especially if you don’t have a spare or the tools to change it. Modern cars often lack full-sized spare tires, increasing reliance on professional help.</p>
    <p>Car recovery services not only transport your vehicle to the nearest repair shop but also offer roadside assistance in many cases. For fast and dependable solutions, turn to <a href="https://derby-recovery.com/">Car Recovery Derby</a>.</p>
