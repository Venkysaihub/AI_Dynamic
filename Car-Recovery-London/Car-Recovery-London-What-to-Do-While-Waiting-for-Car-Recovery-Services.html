    <h1>What to Do While Waiting for Car Recovery Services</h1>
    <p>Getting stuck on the side of the road is stressful, whether it's a flat tire, engine failure, or running out of fuel. While waiting for recovery services, it's important to stay safe, organized, and calm. Here's a guide to help you handle the situation until help arrives.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Prioritize Your Safety</h2>
    <p>Safety is the most important factor when your car breaks down. Follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pull Over to a Safe Spot:</strong> As soon as you notice something wrong, pull over to a safe area away from traffic. Choose a well-lit spot if possible, and avoid stopping in dangerous locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Activate Hazard Lights:</strong> Turn on your hazard lights to warn other drivers. This helps prevent accidents and ensures visibility, especially in poor weather or at night.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Inside Your Vehicle (If Safe):</strong> If you're on a busy road, stay inside the car, seatbelt fastened and doors locked.</li>
        <li><strong>Remain Calm:</strong> Panic can worsen the situation. Take a deep breath, assess the situation, and wait for help.</li>
