    </ul>

    <h2>2. Car Dealership Trade-In</h2>
    <p>Dealerships allow part-exchange when you're buying a new car, making it convenient. However, trade-in values are typically lower than private sale prices.</p>
    <strong>Pros:</strong>

        <li>Limited to buying another car</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Private Sale</h2>
    <p>Selling your car privately via classified ads or Facebook Marketplace might get you the highest price—but it takes time and effort.</p>
    <strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Potential for top price</li>
        <li>Full control of negotiations</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Time-consuming and requires vetting buyers</li>
        <li>No guarantees of sale</li>
        <li>Risk of scams or unreliable buyers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Online Car Buying Sites</h2>
    <p>National car buying platforms offer quick quotes and collection services, but be wary of last-minute price drops after inspection.</p>
    <strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy to start online</li>
        <li>Widespread availability</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Hidden fees or reduced offers upon inspection</li>
        <li>Less personalised support compared to <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Car Auctions</h2>
    <p>Auctions can result in a fast sale, but you have little control over the final price, and seller fees apply.</p>
    <strong>Pros:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Quick turnaround</li>
        <li>Great for certain types of vehicles (e.g. fleet or damaged cars)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Cons:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Unpredictable final sale value</li>
        <li>Fees and commission charges</li>
    </ul>
