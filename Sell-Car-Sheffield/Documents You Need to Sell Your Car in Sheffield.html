      <h1>Documents You Need to Sell Your Car in Sheffield</h1>
      <p>If you're planning to sell your car in Sheffield, it's important to gather the necessary documents to ensure a smooth and efficient transaction. At <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a>, we make the car selling process simple, whether your car is in perfect condition or needs repairs. Here’s a rundown of the essential paperwork required to sell your vehicle.</p>

      <h2>1. V5C Registration Document (Logbook)</h2>
      <p>The **V5C Registration Document** (also known as the logbook) is the most important document when selling your car in Sheffield. It proves you are the registered keeper of the vehicle. If you've lost your logbook, don't worry—contact the DVLA to obtain a replacement. At <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a>, we can help guide you through this process if needed.</p>

      <h2>2. Proof of Identity</h2>
      <p>You will need to provide **proof of identity** when selling your car. A valid **passport** or **driving license** typically suffices. This is important to confirm that the transaction is legitimate. At <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a>, we ensure all identity checks are secure and hassle-free for you.</p>

      <h2>3. MOT Certificate</h2>
      <pWhile it's not mandatory, having a valid **MOT certificate** can increase the value of your car when selling it. If your car is more than three years old, it must pass an MOT to be legally driven on the road. If you don't have an MOT, don't worry—<a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a> will still buy your car, regardless of its MOT status.</p>

      <h2>4. Service History and Receipts</h2>
      <pProviding a **service history** and **maintenance receipts** can show potential buyers that the car has been well-maintained. If you have these documents, be sure to present them when selling your car to <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a>. Although not required, they may help you get a better price for your vehicle.</p>

      <h2>5. Outstanding Finance Details</h2>
      <p>If you have any outstanding finance on the car, you must resolve this before selling. Make sure to contact your finance provider to obtain the necessary details. If your car still has finance remaining, <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a> can help you navigate the process and clear any finance to ensure a smooth sale.</p>

      <h2>6. No Documents? No Problem!</h2>
