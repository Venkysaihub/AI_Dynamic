      <h1>Documents You Need to Sell Your Car in Sheffield</h1>
      <p>When it’s time to sell your car in Sheffield, having the correct documents is essential to ensure a smooth and hassle-free process. At <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a>, we make it easy by providing a straightforward car selling experience. Here’s a list of the key documents you need when selling your car in Sheffield.</p>

      <h2>1. V5C Registration Document (Logbook)</h2>
      <p>The most important document you need when selling your car in Sheffield is the **V5C Registration Document** (also known as the logbook). This proves that you are the registered keeper of the vehicle. If you don’t have the logbook, it may still be possible to sell your car, but it will be more difficult. At <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a>, we can guide you through the process if you’ve lost your logbook.</p>

      <h2>2. Proof of Identity</h2>
      <p>You will also need to provide proof of your identity when selling your car. Typically, this includes a **valid passport** or **driving license**. This is necessary to verify that the car’s sale is legitimate and that you are authorized to sell it. At <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a>, we make sure that all of your documents are checked and verified securely.</p>

      <h2>3. MOT Certificate</h2>
      <p>Although not mandatory, having a valid **MOT certificate** can increase the value of your car when selling it. This proves that the car is roadworthy and has passed all necessary safety checks. If your car is over three years old, it is required to have an MOT to be sold. If you don’t have a valid MOT, <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a> can still buy your car, regardless of its MOT status.</p>

      <h2>4. Service History and Receipts</h2>
      <p>Having a **service history** or any receipts for repairs or maintenance is not mandatory but can help demonstrate that the car has been well maintained. This can increase the value of your car when selling it in Sheffield. If you have service records, be sure to provide them to <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a> to ensure you get the best offer for your vehicle.</p>

      <h2>5. Outstanding Finance Information</h2>
      <p>If you still have outstanding finance on your car, it’s important to resolve this before selling. If you’re unsure, contact your finance provider to confirm the details. At <a href="https://sellcarsheffield.com/">Sell Car Sheffield</a>, we can help guide you through the process if your car has outstanding finance, ensuring that all legal requirements are met.</p>
