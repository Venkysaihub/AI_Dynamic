    <h1>Understanding Insurance Coverage for Car Recovery and Repairs</h1>
    <p>Car insurance often has confusing terms, especially when it comes to car recovery and repair coverage. Understanding what’s included in your policy can help you make informed decisions in emergencies, saving both time and money. Here’s how to check your insurance coverage for recovery and repairs.</p>
    
    <h2>What Is Car Recovery Insurance Coverage?</h2>
    <p>Car recovery coverage is a part of your policy that covers the cost of towing or transporting your car after a breakdown or accident. This may include roadside assistance, towing to a garage, and sometimes repairs.</p>

    <h3>1. Check Your Insurance Policy for Roadside Assistance</h3>
    <p>Many insurance policies offer roadside assistance, which can cover towing, flat tires, fuel shortages, or other breakdowns.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Check for Roadside Assistance:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look for terms like “towing,” “roadside assistance,” or “emergency recovery.”</li>
        <li>Understand towing limits and distances.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Understand Repair Coverage in Your Policy</h3>
    <p>Some policies include repair coverage after accidents or breakdowns. Comprehensive insurance typically covers both recovery and repairs, while third-party insurance may only cover damages to other vehicles.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Check for Repair Coverage:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comprehensive vs. Third-Party Coverage: Comprehensive covers recovery and repairs, while third-party may not.</li>
        <li>Check deductibles and limits on repair costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Review Emergency Breakdown Coverage</h3>
    <p>Some policies include emergency breakdown services, which can cover towing and repairs in specific situations.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Review Emergency Breakdown Coverage:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Look for breakdown clauses in your policy.</li>
        <li>Ensure coverage for various emergencies like mechanical issues, accidents, or battery failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Know the Costs: What’s Included and What’s Not?</h3>
    <p>Understand exclusions and limits in your policy, as towing and recovery may have restrictions.</p>
    <p><strong>What to Look For:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exclusions for towing beyond a specific distance or recovery services not considered emergencies.</li>
        <li>Pre-approved recovery providers.</li>
    </ul>
