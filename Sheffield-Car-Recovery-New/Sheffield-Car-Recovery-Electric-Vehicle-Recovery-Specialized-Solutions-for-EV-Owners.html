    <h2>High-Voltage Battery Systems and the Risk of Damage During EV Recovery</h2>
    <p>The high-voltage battery system in an electric vehicle is the heart of its operation, and improper handling during recovery can lead to serious issues. Damaging this system during a tow can result in expensive repairs or dangerous safety risks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sensitivity to Damage:</strong> Towing an EV improperly may damage its battery, causing malfunction or even complete failure.</li>
