    <h1>Sheffield Car Recovery – Breakdown Recovery vs Accident Recovery: What’s the Difference?</h1>
    <p>When your vehicle breaks down or is involved in an accident, it’s crucial to know whether you need <strong>breakdown recovery</strong> or <strong>accident recovery</strong>. At <a href="https://recoverysheffield.com/">Sheffield Car Recovery</a>, we provide expert recovery services, 24/7. Let us help you understand the key differences so you can make the right decision when you need assistance most.</p>

    <h2>What Is Breakdown Recovery?</h2>
    <p><strong>Breakdown recovery</strong> occurs when your car experiences mechanical or electrical issues, leaving you stranded on the road. Some common causes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flat battery</li>
        <li>Engine failure</li>
        <li>Punctured or flat tyres</li>
        <li>Running out of fuel</li>
        <li>Overheating</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In many cases, our skilled technicians can resolve minor issues on-site. If a roadside fix isn’t possible, we’ll safely tow your vehicle to your chosen garage or repair centre within Sheffield.</p>

    <h2>What Is Accident Recovery?</h2>
    <p><strong>Accident recovery</strong> refers to handling vehicles involved in serious collisions or accidents, which are often unsafe or impossible to drive. Common scenarios include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Severe collisions or crashes</li>
        <li>Cars stuck off-road or in ditches</li>
        <li>Airbag deployment, frame damage, or total vehicle destruction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our team is equipped to recover damaged vehicles safely, ensuring they're transported with the utmost care. We also assist with the insurance process, helping you with claims and necessary documentation.</p>
