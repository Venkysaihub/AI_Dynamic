    <p><strong>Common Exclusions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Towing limits, particularly for distances that exceed the coverage limit.</li>

    <p><strong>How to Clarify Coverage:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask if towing and repairs are fully covered, and if there are limits on these services.</li>
