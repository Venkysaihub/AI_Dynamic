    <h1>Sheffield Car Recovery – Breakdown Recovery vs Accident Recovery: What’s the Difference?</h1>
    <p>When your vehicle leaves you stranded, it’s crucial to know whether you need <strong>breakdown recovery</strong> or <strong>accident recovery</strong>. While both services involve getting your vehicle off the road, the nature of the incident determines the right solution. In this guide, <a href="https://recoverysheffield.com/">Sheffield Car Recovery</a> explains the key differences so you know exactly what to expect in any situation.</p>

    <h2>What Is Breakdown Recovery?</h2>
    <p><strong>Breakdown recovery</strong> refers to assistance when your car stops working due to a mechanical or electrical fault. This can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flat batteries</li>
        <li>Overheating</li>
        <li>Engine failure</li>
        <li>Flat tires or punctures</li>
        <li>Running out of fuel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In most cases, our team can perform quick roadside fixes like jump-starts, tire changes, or fluid top-ups. If the issue is more serious, we’ll tow your vehicle to a garage of your choice in Sheffield.</p>

    <h2>What Is Accident Recovery?</h2>
    <p><strong>Accident recovery</strong> involves the recovery of a vehicle that has been involved in a collision or serious incident. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Road traffic accidents (RTAs)</li>
        <li>Vehicles stuck in ditches or off-road</li>
        <li>Severely damaged or non-drivable cars</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our accident recovery service ensures your vehicle is handled with care, transported safely, and documented properly for insurance purposes. We work with individuals, insurers, and emergency services across Sheffield.</p>
