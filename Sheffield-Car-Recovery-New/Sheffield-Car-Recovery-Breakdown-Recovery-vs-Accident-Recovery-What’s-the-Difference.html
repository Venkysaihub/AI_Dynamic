    <h1>Sheffield Car Recovery – Breakdown Recovery vs Accident Recovery: What’s the Difference?</h1>
    <p>When your vehicle fails you, knowing the right service to call makes all the difference.

In this guide, we’ll explain the key differences to help you choose the right solution and get back on the road fast.</p>

    <h2>What Is Breakdown Recovery?</h2>
    <p>Breakdown recovery refers to assistance when your car stops working due to a mechanical or electrical issue. Common causes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flat battery</li>
        <li>Engine failure</li>
        <li>Punctured or flat tyre</li>
        <li>Running out of fuel</li>
        <li>Overheating</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In many cases, our technicians can resolve minor issues on-site. If not, we’ll tow your vehicle to a garage or destination of your choice in Sheffield.</p>

    <h2>What Is Accident Recovery?</h2>
    <p>Accident recovery is required when your vehicle is involved in a road traffic collision or has suffered physical damage that makes it unsafe or impossible to drive. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Severe crashes or collisions</li>
        <li>Cars stuck off-road or in ditches</li>
        <li>Airbag deployment or frame damage</li>
    </ul>
