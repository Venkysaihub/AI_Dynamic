    <h1>How to Avoid Electrical Hazards During Sheffield’s Winter Months</h1>
    <p>Winter in Sheffield brings colder temperatures, increased energy usage, and a higher risk of electrical hazards. To ensure your home remains safe and efficient, follow these expert tips to prevent common winter electrical issues.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Prevent Overloaded Circuits</h2>
    <p>With the increased use of electric heaters, festive lights, and appliances during winter, overloading your circuits can become a real hazard.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Distribute Load Evenly:</strong> Avoid plugging too many high-power devices into one socket.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Surge Protectors:</strong> Protect your appliances and reduce the risk of electrical fires.</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrade Your Electrical Panel:</strong> If your home has an outdated panel, consider an upgrade for better safety.</li>

    <h2>2. Be Cautious with Electric Heaters</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep Heaters Away from Flammable Materials:</strong> Ensure a safe distance from curtains, furniture, and bedding.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Extension Cords:</strong> Plug heaters directly into wall outlets to prevent overheating.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Weatherproof Lights:</strong> Ensure all outdoor lighting is rated for exterior use.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for Damaged Wires:</strong> Replace any frayed or damaged cords to prevent short circuits.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Timers:</strong> Set lights to turn off automatically to reduce energy consumption and fire risks.</li>
