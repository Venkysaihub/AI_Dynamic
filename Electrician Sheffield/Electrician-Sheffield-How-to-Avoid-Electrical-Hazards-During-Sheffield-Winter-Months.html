    <h1>How to Avoid Electrical Hazards During Sheffield’s Winter Months</h1>
    <p>Winter in Sheffield brings colder temperatures and increased reliance on electrical heating and lighting. However, improper use of electrical devices can lead to hazards such as fires, shocks, and power outages. Follow these safety tips to protect your home and loved ones.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Safe Use of Electric Heaters</h2>
    <p>Electric heaters provide warmth, but they can be dangerous if used improperly. Here’s how to use them safely:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep Heaters Away from Flammable Materials:</strong> Maintain at least three feet of space around heaters.</li>
        <li><strong>Do Not Overload Circuits:</strong> Plug heaters directly into a wall outlet, not an extension cord.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn Off When Not in Use:</strong> Never leave heaters running unattended.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Preventing Electrical Overloads</h2>
    <p>With holiday lighting, extra appliances, and heating devices in use, circuits can become overloaded. Prevent hazards by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distributing electrical loads across multiple outlets.</li>
        <li>Using power strips with surge protection.</li>
        <li>Checking your electrical panel for signs of overload, such as flickering lights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Handling Power Outages Safely</h2>
    <p>Winter storms can cause power outages. Stay prepared with these tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have battery-powered flashlights and emergency supplies ready.</li>
        <li>Use generators safely by keeping them outside and away from windows.</li>
        <li>Unplug appliances to prevent power surges when electricity is restored.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Frequent circuit breaker trips.</li>
        <li>Burning smells or discolored outlets.</li>
        <li>Flickering or dimming lights when appliances run.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Using weatherproof covers on outdoor outlets.</li>
        <li>Checking extension cords for wear and tear.</li>
