    <h2>1. Frequent Circuit Breaker Tripping</h2>
    <p>If your circuit breaker trips frequently, it could be a sign of faulty wiring or an overloaded circuit. This happens when the electrical system is trying to prevent overheating or potential fires.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Overloaded Circuits:</strong> Too many appliances drawing power from the same circuit can cause tripping.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Loose Connections:</strong> Loose wiring in your electrical system can cause lights to flicker.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Overheating Wires:</strong> Damaged or overloaded wires can overheat and produce a burning smell.</li>
