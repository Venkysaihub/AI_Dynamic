    <h1>What to Do While Waiting for Car Recovery Services in Coventry</h1>
    <p>When your vehicle breaks down in Coventry, whether due to a flat tire, running out of fuel, or engine trouble, waiting for car recovery services can be stressful. Here's how to stay safe, organized, and calm during the wait for professional assistance.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Prioritize Safety and Visibility</h2>
    <p>Your safety is the most important thing when your car breaks down. Follow these steps to stay safe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Move to a Safe Area:</strong> As soon as you notice something wrong, pull your car off the road to a safe area. If you can’t move it, stay away from the car and avoid high-traffic lanes.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn on Hazard Lights:</strong> Always activate your hazard lights to alert other drivers, especially in low-visibility conditions or at night.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Inside Your Vehicle (If Safe):</strong> If you're on a busy road, stay inside your car with your seatbelt fastened and doors locked for added safety.</li>
    </ul>
