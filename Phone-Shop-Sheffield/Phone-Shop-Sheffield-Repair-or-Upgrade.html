    <h2>1. Is Your Phone Repairable?</h2>

    <h2>2. When Is It Time to Upgrade?</h2>
    <p>While repairs are often a great option, there are times when upgrading your phone is the more practical solution. If your phone is old or experiencing frequent breakdowns, upgrading might be the better choice.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Tell if You Should Upgrade:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frequent Failures:</strong> If your phone is constantly malfunctioning despite repairs, it may be time for a new device.</li>
        <li><strong>Outdated Features:</strong> Older models may not support the latest software or features, leaving you behind on new capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Slow Performance:</strong> If your phone is running sluggishly and repairs can’t fix the issue, it might be time to get an upgrade.</li>
