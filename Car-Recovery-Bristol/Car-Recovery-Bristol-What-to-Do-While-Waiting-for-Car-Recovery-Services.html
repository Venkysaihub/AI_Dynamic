    <h1>What to Do While Waiting for Car Recovery Services in Bristol</h1>
    <p>Getting stuck on the road in Bristol can be stressful, whether it's a flat tire, engine failure, or running out of fuel. While waiting for recovery services, it's essential to stay calm, safe, and organized. This guide will help you handle the situation efficiently until help arrives.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Prioritize Your Safety</h2>
    <p>Your safety is the most important factor during a breakdown. Follow these steps to stay safe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pull Over to a Safe Spot:</strong> As soon as you notice an issue, pull over to a safe area away from traffic. Try to choose a well-lit spot if possible, and avoid stopping in high-risk locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Activate Hazard Lights:</strong> Turn on your hazard lights to alert other drivers. This improves visibility, especially in poor weather or during night-time.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Inside Your Vehicle (If Safe):</strong> If you're on a busy road, stay inside the car, keep your seatbelt fastened, and lock the doors.</li>
        <li><strong>Remain Calm:</strong> It’s natural to feel stressed, but remaining calm can help you assess the situation more clearly and wait for recovery services without panic.</li>
