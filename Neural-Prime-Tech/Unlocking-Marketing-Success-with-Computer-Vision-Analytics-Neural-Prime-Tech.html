    <h1>How Computer Vision is Transforming Marketing Analytics</h1>
    <p>In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, data alone isn't enough. Visual data—the kind captured in videos, images, and camera feeds—holds untapped potential. At <a href="https://neuralprimetech.com/">Neural Prime Tech</a>, we are pioneering the use of <strong>computer vision in marketing analytics</strong> to deliver real-time, AI-powered insights that redefine customer engagement and decision-making.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Computer Vision in Marketing?</h2>
    <p>Computer vision refers to AI systems that can process and understand visual information. In marketing, this translates to interpreting customer behavior, detecting objects or products in imagery, and analyzing emotional responses—all from video or image-based inputs. The result? Sharper strategy and higher ROI.</p>

    <h2>Key Applications of Computer Vision in Marketing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In-Store Behavior Tracking:</strong> Capture and analyze how customers interact with products on shelves to optimize store layouts and displays.</li>
        <li><strong>Facial Emotion Recognition:</strong> Gauge customer reactions to campaigns, displays, or experiences using emotion detection technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Brand Exposure Analysis:</strong> Identify when and where your brand appears in social media, public events, or UGC (user-generated content).</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Performance Optimization:</strong> Analyze engagement with video ads in real time to fine-tune content for better conversion rates.</li>
    </ul>
