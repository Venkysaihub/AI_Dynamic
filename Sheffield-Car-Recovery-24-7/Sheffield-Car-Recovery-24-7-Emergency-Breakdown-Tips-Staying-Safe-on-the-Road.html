    <h2>1. Pull Over and Secure Your Vehicle</h2>
    <p>When your vehicle breaks down, your first priority is to pull over to a safe location, especially on busy roads or highways around Sheffield.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Steps for Pulling Over Safely:</strong> Signal your intentions to other drivers, then find a safe spot off the road, such as the shoulder or a nearby parking lot. Avoid stopping in areas with limited visibility like curves or bridges.</li>

    <h2>2. Activate Your Hazard Lights</h2>
    <p>Once you're safely off the road, turn on your hazard lights to alert other drivers to your situation.</p>
    <p><strong>Why Hazard Lights Are Important:</strong> They signal that your vehicle is in distress, allowing other drivers to approach with caution, especially in poor visibility conditions in Sheffield.</p>

    <h2>3. Stay Inside the Vehicle When Possible</h2>
    <p>It’s safest to stay inside your vehicle, particularly on busy roads and highways in Sheffield.</p>

    <p><strong>Being Prepared:</strong> Keep emergency supplies in your vehicle, including a flashlight, first aid kit, and road flares. Ensure your insurance details and contact information are easily accessible.</p>
