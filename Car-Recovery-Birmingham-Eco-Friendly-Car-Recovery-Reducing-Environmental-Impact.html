    <h1>Eco-Friendly Car Recovery: Reducing Environmental Impact</h1>
    <p>As environmental awareness grows, the car recovery industry is adopting eco-friendly practices to minimize its ecological footprint. Whether dealing with a breakdown, accident, or old car disposal, there are several green initiatives reshaping the recovery process. This blog will cover the most effective eco-friendly practices, including fuel-efficient towing, vehicle part recycling, and hazardous material disposal.</p>
