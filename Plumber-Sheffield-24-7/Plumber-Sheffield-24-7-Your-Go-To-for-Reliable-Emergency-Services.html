    <h2>1. Blocked Drains</h2>
    <p>Blocked drains are one of the most common plumbing issues in Sheffield. Whether it’s in the kitchen, bathroom, or utility room, a blocked drain can lead to slow drainage, bad odors, and potential flooding if not addressed quickly.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Water draining slowly from sinks, bathtubs, or toilets.</li>
        <li>Foul smells coming from your drains.</li>

    <h2>4. Low Water Pressure</h2>
    <p>Low water pressure can be caused by various issues, such as a leak in the pipes or a faulty pressure regulator. If the water pressure in your home or business is consistently low, it’s important to have it inspected by a professional plumber.</p>
